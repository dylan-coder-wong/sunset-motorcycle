        <h2>I started programing in scratch before doing anything else. Scratch is an online visual programing website. I started coding when i was 8 and really liked it. My name is Dylan i'm 10 years old and I'm an Indie Game Dev. I use a couple different languages. C#, CSS, Javascript, Python, and html.
        My favorite language to use is Javascript. I like it because it is a typless language and it flows way better than something like Python where you can't put semicolins at the end of your sentences. It's like writing with no spaces or periods.
    Recently. I've been working on a Motercycle game. I used a tutarial for the base of the game. AKA just the driving part, not the main menu or anything like that.
